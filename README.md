- I am currently a second-year software engineering technology major who hopes to break into technology companies. I solve problems in creative ways. This year, I am not just obtaining my knowledge from my school. However, I improve my skills by building new software projects in different languages. And I also participate in volunteer jobs for getting real experience besides tons of projects in school and GitHub.
